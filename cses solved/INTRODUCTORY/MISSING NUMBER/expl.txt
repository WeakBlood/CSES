This problem can be easily solved by utilizing the fact that only one number is missing. 
This means that, after sorting the array, all the numbers must follow the rule "arr[i] = i". The first number that doesn't adhere to this rule will be identified as the missing number. This algorithm operates in O(NlogN) time complexity. 
However, the worst-case scenario for the sorting process can be O(N^2) due to the nature of quicksort.
In case you can want to keep the complexity always under O(N^2) you can substitute the sort function with a simple implementation of merge sort
which operates in O(N log2N).
