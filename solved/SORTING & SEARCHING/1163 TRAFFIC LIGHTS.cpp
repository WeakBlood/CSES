//!!!EXPLANATION!!!:
/* 
For this problem, we will simulate the problem by manually adding each traffic light and changing the lens as consequence,
but what can we notice? Do we actually need to change every single interval after we add only one traffic light? 
No, we just need to change the one traffic light after our new one and the one before, by doing this we will reduce
the number of operations drastically by just searching with a lower_bound the first value that is greater 
than our new traffic light. 
For being more explicit if we have intervals from {0,5} {7,9} {10,30} the lens will be {5,2,2,1,20}; 
so if we add a new traffic light at position 20 what happens? only the interval {10,30} gets split into two parts.
So after the operation we will have {0,5} {7,9} {10,20} {30}; so the new lens will be {5,2,2,1,10,10}; as you can see, only 
the 2 numbers withing the range of added traffic light needed an updated.

Time complexity: O(N logâ‚™)
