//!!!EXPLANATION!!!:
/* 
In this problem, i should have noticed that all the arrival and leaving times are distinct in order to use a shorter solution, 
So for solving this problem i used a combination of map and vector, since going from 0 to 1e9 and checking each time if something happens is not that efficient, 
we can just flag with the map the times when SOMETHING happens, and register if it is customer I joining, or customer I leaving, after we process all
actions of a given time, we can check who's left. There is no need to check the in between time ( the times where nothing happens ) because it 
will be the same in all of them.

Time complexity: O(N logâ‚™);
