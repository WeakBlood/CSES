//!!!EXPLANATION!!!:
/* 
For this problem we are going to use a map for tracking the frequency in which a certain value appears, 
and if at any given moment the sum the prefix sum from to i-th value - X points to a value that has already appeared 
it means that we can form X from that value + our actual pfx, so add that to the answer.
Remember that in this version we must use a long long for storing the answer since we will go into negative values 
more often.

Time complexity O(N logâ‚™)
