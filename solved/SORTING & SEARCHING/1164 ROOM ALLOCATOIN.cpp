//!!!EXPLANATION!!!:
/* 
In this problem, we can start by sorting our guests arrivals and departure times, 
once we do this, we can use a set for keeping track of which guests are in which room, 
we don't need to check for each room but rather for the departure times of the guests since 
with just that information we can check if there is someone who will leave the room empty before we arrive.
For doing this in code we use a set, as i said and in this set we memorize {endingTime,startingTime,idRoom}, 
when a guest arrives if by doing lower_bound i go higher than the start of the set it means that there is 
at least one guest which departure time is strictly less than my arrival time so i can take that room else 
i have to "create" another room.

Time complexity: O(N logâ‚™)
