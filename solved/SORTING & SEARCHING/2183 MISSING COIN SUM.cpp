//!!!EXPLANATION!!!:
/* 
This one is a bit tricky but still, for solving this the key is noticing that whenever a certain number is strictly greater than the sum off all of it's 
previous numbers + 1 it means that there is a gap, in possible sums, THAT ONE is the answer to our problem.
Don't believe me ? take v = {1,2,2,5,9}; the answer here is 20 why ? well,
We start with sum = 1
1 >= 1, 2 >= 2, 4 >= 2, 6>= 5, 11 >= 9, 20 >= NULL. The code ends.
1 was possible because there is one, 3 was possible cause 1+2, 8 was possible cause 5+2+1, etc.
But let's change the fourth number and make it 7, now we have v = {1,2,2,7,9};
1 >= 1, 2 >= 2, 4 >= 2, 6>=7... this is not true, so the code stops and answer is in fact, 6.
Time complexity O(N logâ‚™)
